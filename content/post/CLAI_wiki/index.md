I am now the Principal Maintainer of ContinualAI [wiki platform](https://wiki.continualai.org/index.html). In there, you can find information about the exciting world of Continual Learning and a [list of CL papers](https://wiki.continualai.org/research.html) which should be very easy for you to browse.  
We are working to keep the list updated, but we can really use your help. Feel free to contribute to this open-source project by taking a look at our [GitHub wiki repository](https://github.com/ContinualAI/wiki), which includes a README with all the (very simple) details.  
You can find more information about ContinualAI by visiting the [official website](https://www.continualai.org/). In case you want to get in touch or get involved in the community, the first thing to do is [joining the Slack](https://continualai.herokuapp.com/), where a growing number of CL researchers is finding a great place to cooperate and discuss.
