I will participate in the [**Eastern European Machine Learning Summer School**](https://www.eeml.eu/) next July. Even if virtually held, I am sure it will be a stimulating experience, with many important speakers already announced.
I will present a poster of my recent work on [Continual Learning with Gated Incremental Memories](https://andreacossu.github.io/publication/ijcnn2020-gim/). Hope to see many CL researchers there!
