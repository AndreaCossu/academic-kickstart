Our [paper](https://andreacossu.github.io/publication/ijcnn2020-gim/) about Continual Learning with Gated Incremental Memories, a progressive recurrent neural network, is available as a pre-print on [arXiv!](https://andreacossu.github.io/publication/ijcnn2020-gim/).  
It has also been accepted at IJCNN 2020.
