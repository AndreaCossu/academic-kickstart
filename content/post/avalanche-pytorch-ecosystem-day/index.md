Our recently released Continual Learning library [Avalanche](https://avalanche.continualai.org/) will be presented at the first [Pytorch Ecosystem Day](https://pytorchecosystemday.fbreg.com/).  
We are very excited to introduce the tool to the Pytorch community and to showcase its great functionalities!
