The [blog post](https://medium.com/continual-ai/continual-learning-with-recurrent-neural-networks-ce631c913b0) about our recent work [published in Neural Networks](https://andreacossu.github.io/publication/cossu-2021-b/) is out on Medium! 
Check it out if you want to quickly understand the importance of recurrent models in continual learning.
