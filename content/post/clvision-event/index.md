The Continual Learning in Computer Vision (CLVision) workshop at CVPR just ended!  
We livestreamed all the invited talks, panel discussion and best paper posters, for a total of around 8 hours of live stream!

You can check the event out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIV3qgOVvDQ&t=541s).
