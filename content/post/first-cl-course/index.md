The [first course on Continual Learning](https://course.continualai.org/) is about to start! 
The course is hosted by University of Pisa and ContinualAI and Vincenzo Lomonaco will be the teacher. I will help throughout the course as teaching assistant.  
More than 400 students already signed up, this is huge :)
