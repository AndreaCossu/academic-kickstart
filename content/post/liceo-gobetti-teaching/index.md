I got the opportunity and the pleasure to talk about Neural Networks to students of high-school Liceo Gobetti, Florence.  
These students are starting their journey towards a more detailed understanding of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and all the accomplishments and problems these topics bring into play. 

Thanks to the [Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence](https://aixia.it/) for inviting me to this event!
