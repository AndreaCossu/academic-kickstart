Our [recently published paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11750v1) has been selected as one of the two oral presentations at the [GLB workshop](https://graph-learning-benchmarks.github.io/) within the 2021 WWW conference.  
Glad to see that the study of continual learning with deep graph networks raised the interest of the research community :)
