abstract: In this work, we study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting in the
  graph representation learning scenario. The primary objective of the analysis is
  to understand whether classical continual learning techniques for flat and sequential
  data have a tangible impact on performances when applied to graph data. To do so,
  we experiment with a structure-agnostic model and a deep graph network in a robust
  and controlled environment on three different datasets. The benchmark is complemented
  by an investigation on the effect of structure-preserving regularization techniques
  on catastrophic forgetting. We find that replay is the most effective strategy in
  so far, which also benefits the most from the use of regularization. Our findings
  suggest interesting future research at the intersection of the continual and graph
  representation learning fields. Finally, we provide researchers with a flexible
  software framework to reproduce our results and carry out further experiments.
