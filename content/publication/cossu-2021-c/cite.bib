 abstract = {The increasing attention on Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulamentation has led to the definition of a set of ethical principles grouped into the Sustainable AI framework. In this article, we identify Continual Learning, an active area of AI research, as a promising approach towards the design of systems compliant with the Sustainable AI principles. While Sustainable AI outlines general desiderata for ethical applications, Continual Learning provides means to put such desiderata into practice.},
