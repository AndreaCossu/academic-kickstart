abstract: The increasing attention on Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulamentation
  has led to the definition of a set of ethical principles grouped into the Sustainable
  AI framework. In this article, we identify Continual Learning, an active area of
  AI research, as a promising approach towards the design of systems compliant with
  the Sustainable AI principles. While Sustainable AI outlines general desiderata
  for ethical applications, Continual Learning provides means to put such desiderata
  into practice.
