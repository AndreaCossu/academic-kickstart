abstract: Learning continually from non-stationary data streams is a long-standing
  goal and a challenging problem in machine learning. Recently, we have witnessed
  a renewed and fast-growing interest in continual learning, especially within the
  deep learning community. However, algorithmic solutions are often difficult to re-implement,
  evaluate and port across different settings, where even results on standard benchmarks
  are hard to reproduce. In this work, we propose Avalanche, an open-source end-to-end
  library for continual learning research based on PyTorch. Avalanche is designed
  to provide a shared and collaborative codebase for fast prototyping, training, and
  reproducible evaluation of continual learning algorithms.
